// Magic Square Rules
// 3 x 3 magic square needs to sum up to 15.
// 4 corners of the square need to be even numbers
// Middle square is going to always be a 5
// Numbers surrounding the 5 thats are not corners need to be odd numbers
// Diagonal corner numbers have the be either [2 and 8] or [4 and 6] because they have to add up to 10 since the sum of the diagonal should be 10 + 5(since 5 is always in the middle)
// Odd diagonals also have to add up to 10 so the pairs for those are [7 and 3] or [9 and 1]
